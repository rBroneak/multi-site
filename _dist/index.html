			<h1>Hello!</h1>
			<h2>My name is Robert Broneak</h2>
			<hr>
		
		<section class="primary-content">
		<p>I was born in St. Paul where I spent the next 20 years trying to figure out what to make of myself. I had been oil painting, drawing, and producing things that had no purpose but their own, my whole life. Studying art and design seemed a natural fit. I went to college in Missoula MT where I studied fine art. The program was pretty underfunded so I came back to MN and studied interactive media, 3d animation ,and post-modern theory at MCAD. I finished my BFA at MCAD and began making art and doing front-end dev work for ad agencies and freelance clients here in Minneapolis. Currently, I"m a lead senior front-end developer with a creative approach to problem solving at azul seven in Minneapolis Minnesota.</p><p>Aside from a brief education/career history, I live in St. Paul Minnesota, play hockey, practice kung-fu, find time to make art, try to be a great husband, try to be a great dad, try to be a good friend, try to get out of town and into the woods, and relax when I can.</p>
